# Commands used in Peter's 2016-08-29 demo
ansible ubuntu_vm -m ping
ansible-playbook -K apt-loop.yml
# Commands from VM to verify that pkg's were installed
dpkg -l {git,nginx}
# Run the same command using Ansible's 'command' module
ansible ubuntu_vm -m command -a 'dpkg -l git'
ansible ubuntu_vm -m command -a 'dpkg -l nginx'
# Since 'command' is the default module, you don't need to specify it
ansible ubuntu_vm -a 'dpkg -l git'
ansible ubuntu_vm -a 'dpkg -l nginx'

# NOTE: Doesn't seem to be possible to execute multiple commands in a
# single invocation of 'ansible -a'

# NOTE2: In my ansible 'hosts' file I have to specify the path to the
# python 2 binary b/c on Archlinux 'python' points to Python 3

# NOTE3: In 'Ansible Configuration Management' 1ed the sample
# playbook for conditional execution in Ch3 has some syntax that
# doesn't work in Ansible 2.0+, namely:
#
# debug: msg=... fail=yes
#
# If you remove 'fail=yes' the task works fine, however
