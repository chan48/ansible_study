# Commands used in Peter's 2016-08-29 demo
ansible all -m ping
ansible-playbook -K apt-loop.yml
# Commands from VM to verify that pkg's were installed
dpkg -l {git,nginx}
rpm -q {git,nginx}
# Run the same command using Ansible's 'command' module
ansible ubuntu_vm -m command -a 'dpkg -l git'
ansible ubuntu_vm -m command -a 'dpkg -l nginx'

# Since 'command' is the default module, you don't need to specify it
ansible ubuntu_vm -a 'dpkg -l git'
ansible ubuntu_vm -a 'dpkg -l nginx'

# NOTE: Doesn't seem to be possible to execute multiple commands in a
# single invocation of 'ansible -a'

# NOTE2: In my ansible 'hosts' file I explicity specify the path to the
# python 2 binary. In some linux distro's, (i.e. Archlinux) 'python'
# points to Python 3

# NOTE3: In 'Ansible Configuration Management' 1ed the sample
# playbook for conditional execution in Ch3 has some syntax that
# doesn't work in Ansible 2.0+, namely:
#
# debug: msg=... fail=yes
#
# If you remove 'fail=yes' the task works fine, however

# NOTE4: Don't forget to customize the 'ansible.cfg' file from this
# repository to match the path you 'git clone' to. Under [defaults]
# it is the first setting 'inventory = '
